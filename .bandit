# Skip the following tests:
#
# - [B303:blacklist] Use of insecure MD2, MD4, or MD5 hash function.
#   Severity: Medium   Confidence: High
#       We have to include MD5 file hashes for compatibility with other security tools,
#       but we also include SHA256 hashes.
#
# - [B322:blacklist] On Python 2, use raw_input instead, input is safe in Python 3.
#   Severity: High   Confidence: High
#       The input() function is safe in Python 3.
#
# - [B404:blacklist] Consider possible security implications associated with subprocess module.
#   Severity: Low   Confidence: High
#       There are other warnings specific to subprocess calls (e.g. B603, B607)
#
# - [B603:subprocess_without_shell_equals_true] subprocess call - check for execution of untrusted input.
#   Severity: Low   Confidence: High
#       Subprocess is used primarily in the CLI and is safe from shell injection when shell=False.
#
# - [B607:start_process_with_partial_path] Starting a process with a partial executable path
#   Severity: Low   Confidence: High
#       For portability, we use 'terraform' and 'git' instead of the full executable filepaths.
