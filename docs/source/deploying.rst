Deploying
=========
After you've `setup your environment <getting-started.html>`_, deploying BinaryAlert is as easy as:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ ./manage.py deploy

A ``deploy`` is equivalent to the following 4 operations executed in sequence:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ ./manage.py unit_test    # Unit tests ensure YARA rules compile correctly
  $ ./manage.py build        # Build the Lambda ".zip" deployment packages
  $ ./manage.py apply        # Runs "terraform apply" to update the infrastructure
  $ ./manage.py analyze_all  # Starts a batch analysis of the entire S3 bucket

.. warning:: To ensure new YARA rules are applied ASAP, **every** ``deploy`` starts a batch analysis. If a batch analysis is already running or if you are not updating any YARA rules, you can just ``build`` and ``apply`` your changes.


.. _lambda_versioning:

Lambda Versions and Aliases
---------------------------
Each BinaryAlert Lambda function has a ``Production`` alias which points to the most recent version of that function. Every time a deploy changes one of the Lambda deployment packages, a new version is published and the ``Production`` alias is updated accordingly. For more information, see `AWS Lambda Function Versioning and Aliases <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/versioning-aliases.html>`_.


.. _add_sns_subscriptions:

Add SNS Subscriptions
---------------------
BinaryAlert sends YARA match alerts to an `SNS <https://aws.amazon.com/sns/>`_ topic. In order to receive these alerts, you must manually `add a subscription <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/SubscribeTopic.html>`_ to the generated ``NAME_PREFIX_binaryalert_yara_match_alerts`` topic. SNS supports a variety of subscription endpoints, including email, SMS, and other Lambda functions. Email/SMS subscriptions must be confirmed by the destination, which is why this step can't be automated with Terraform.

For example, since `StreamAlert <https://streamalert.io>`_ supports `SNS datasources <https://streamalert.io/datasources.html#aws-sns>`_, you could use StreamAlert to forward the YARA match alert to PagerDuty, Slack, etc.


Terraform State
---------------
By default, Terraform will save the state of the infrastructure locally in ``terraform/terraform.tfstate``. If you are deploying BinaryAlert in an enterprise environment, we recommend configuring `Terraform remote state <https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/remote.html>`_. For example, you can store the Terraform state in a versioned `S3 bucket <https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/s3.html>`_.


Terraform Commands
------------------
We recommend using the ``manage.py`` wrapper script for most BinaryAlert management because it provides additional validation. However, you can run ``terraform`` commands directly from the ``terraform/`` directory. Examples:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ cd terraform/
  $ terraform plan  # Show pending changes
  $ terraform show  # Print the current state of the infrastructure


.. _terraform_destroy:

Terraform Destroy
.................
To teardown all of the BinaryAlert infrastructure:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ cd terraform/
  $ terraform destroy

.. note:: By default, S3 objects will not be deleted by ``terraform destroy``. To do so, you must first enable the ``force_destroy`` option in the ``terraform/terraform.tfvars`` configuration file and ``apply`` the change.
