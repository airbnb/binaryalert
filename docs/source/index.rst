BinaryAlert is a serverless, real-time framework for detecting malicious files. BinaryAlert can efficiently analyze millions of files a day with a configurable set of `YARA <http://virustotal.github.io/yara/>`_ rules and will trigger an alert as soon as anything malicious is discovered! Organizations can deploy BinaryAlert to their private AWS account in a matter of minutes, allowing them to analyze internal files and documents within the confines of their own environment.


Features
--------

* **Built with Amazon Web Services (AWS):** An AWS account is all you need to deploy BinaryAlert.
* **Broad YARA support:** BinaryAlert includes dozens of YARA rules out-of-the-box and makes it easy to add your own rules or clone them from other open-source repositories.
* **Real-Time:** Files uploaded to BinaryAlert (S3 bucket) are immediately queued for analysis.
* **Serverless:** All computation is handled by `Lambda <https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/>`_ functions. No servers to manage means stronger security and automatic scaling!
* **Infrastructure-As-Code:** The entire infrastructure is described with `Terraform <https://www.terraform.io/>`_ configuration files, enabling anyone to deploy BinaryAlert in a matter of minutes with a single command.
* **Retroactive Analysis:** After updating the YARA ruleset, BinaryAlert will retroactively scan the entire file corpus to find any new matches.
* **Production-Ready:** BinaryAlert ships with a custom metric dashboard and alarms which automatically trigger if BinaryAlert is not operating as expected.
* **Low Cost:** The AWS bill is based only on how many files you upload and how often they are re-analyzed. BinaryAlert can analyze 1 TB for around `$60/month <https://medium.com/@austinbyers/good-question-693200ef5830>`_.
